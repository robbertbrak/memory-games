User: Create a pure Javascript game that shows a grid of 9 squares. First, the computer highlights a sequence of 5 squares. Next, the user has to mimic the sequence by clicking on the correct squares. When the user answers correctly and clicks "next", the next sequence is shown. When the user clicks a wrong square, there is an error message. When the user clicks "next", the next sequence is shown. After mimicking 3 sequences correctly, the next sequence becomes one longer. After getting 3 sequences wrong, the next sequence becomes one shorter.

AI: Okay, I need to create a pure JavaScript game based on the user's description. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the game has a grid of 9 squares. The computer highlights a sequence of 5 squares initially. The user clicks the same sequence, and if correct, they move to the next sequence. If wrong, an error message appears.

I'll start by setting up the HTML structure. I need a grid container with 9 child divs. Each div should have a class for styling, like 'grid-cell' and maybe some unique IDs for later use. Also, a display area for the current sequence length and buttons to start or move to the next level.

Next, JavaScript variables: I'll need an array to represent each cell by its ID, maybe from 0 to 8. Variables for storing the correct sequence and the user's input. A score counter is essential to track progress. Another variable will track whether a new sequence has been generated after user input.

For styling, the grid should be responsive, so CSS Grid is perfect. Each cell should have different colors when active or being clicked. I'll add classes for these states and define styles in the head section.

Now, the core functionality:

1. **Generate Sequence**: The computer picks a random sequence of squares based on the current level. Initially, it's 5 cells long. After each correct attempt, the length increases after every 3 sequences, but I need to cap it somewhere.

2. **User Input Handling**: When the user clicks on cells, they should mimic the sequence. I'll track their clicks and compare them against the stored correct sequence.

3. **Check Sequence**: After the user clicks the same number of squares as the current sequence length, check if they match. Show an error if wrong or proceed to the next step if correct.

4. **Next Button Handling**: This button will generate a new sequence for the next level. It also increments the score and adjusts the sequence length based on correct or incorrect previous attempts.

5. **Score and Level Management**: After 3 correct sequences, increase the length by 1. If the user makes a mistake, decrease the length but only after 3 wrong tries.

I'll outline the functions:

- **generateSequence()**: Generates a random sequence of cells based on the current level.
- **checkUserInput()**: Compares the user's clicked sequence with the correct one.
- **handleNextClick()**: Handles moving to the next level, updating the score and sequence length accordingly.

I'll also need event listeners for each cell click to capture the user's input. When a cell is clicked, it's added to the user's current attempt, but only if they haven't completed their input yet (i.e., clicked as many squares as the current sequence length).

For visual feedback, when a cell is selected by either the computer or the user, it should briefly change color. This helps in providing immediate feedback.

Testing edge cases: What if the level gets too high? Maybe cap it at 9 to prevent overwhelming the user. Also, ensure that after incorrect sequences, the length decreases appropriately but doesn't go below a minimum (maybe 1).

I'll structure the HTML with the grid cells, add the necessary CSS for styling, and implement the JavaScript logic in the script tag. Functions will handle generating sequences, checking correctness, updating the score, and managing transitions between levels.

Finally, I'll make sure to initialize everything when the page loads, setting up the initial sequence and event listeners. The game should be interactive, with clear feedback to the user through both messages and visual cues.

Here's a complete implementation of the game in JavaScript:

            margin: 20px auto;
        }

        .grid-cell {
            width: 50px;
            height: 50px;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            cursor: pointer;
            transition: all 0.3s ease;
        }

        .grid-cell.active {
            background-color: #90EE90;
        }

        .grid-cellclicked {

        #message, #score {

<body>
    <div id="score">Sequence Length: 5</div>
    <div id="message"></div>
    <div id="game" class="grid" onclick="handleCellClick(event)"></div>
    <button onclick="handleNextClick()">Next</button>

    <script>
        const cells = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
        const cellElements = document.getElementsByClassName('grid-cell');
        const messageElement = document.getElementById('message');
        const gameElement = document.getElementById('game');
        const scoreElement = document.getElementById('score');

        let correctSequence = [];
        let userSequence = [];
        let score = 0;
        let currentLevel = 5;
        let isNewGame = true;

        function initializeGame() {
            // Create grid cells
            cells.forEach(cellNumber => {
                const cell = document.createElement('div');
                cell.className = 'grid-cell';
                cell.textContent = cellNumber;
                gameElement.appendChild(cell);
            });
        }

        function generateSequence(length) {
            return Array.from({length}, () =>
                Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1
            );
        }

        function handleCellClick(event) {
            if (!isNewGame) return;

            const cell = event.target;
            const cellNumber = parseInt(cell.textContent);

            if (userSequence.length < currentLevel) {
                userSequence.push(cellNumber);

                // Visual feedback
                cell.classList.add('grid-cellclicked');
                setTimeout(() => cell.classList.remove('grid-cellclicked'), 300);

                // Check sequence after user completes input
                if (userSequence.length === currentLevel) {
                    setTimeout(checkUserInput, 500);
                }
            }
        }

        function checkUserInput() {
            if (JSON.stringify(userSequence) === JSON.stringify(correctSequence)) {
                messageElement.textContent = "Correct!";
                score++;

                // Every 3 correct sequences, increase level
                if ((score % 3) === 0) {
                    currentLevel++;
                }

                isNewGame = false;
            } else {
                messageElement.textContent = "Incorrect sequence! Try again.";
            }

            userSequence = [];
        }

        function handleNextClick() {
            // Every 3 wrong sequences, decrease level
            if (score % 3 !== 0 && score > 0) {
                currentLevel--;
            }

            correctSequence = generateSequence(currentLevel);
            isNewGame = true;
            messageElement.textContent = "";
            userSequence = [];
            scoreElement.textContent = `Sequence Length: ${currentLevel}`;

            // Visual feedback for correct sequence
            correctSequence.forEach(cellNumber => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    document.getElementById(`cell-${cellNumber}`).classList.add('active');
                    setTimeout(() => document.getElementById(`cell-${cellNumber}`).classList.remove('active'), 300);
                }, 500 * index);
            });
        }

        // Initialize the game
        initializeGame();
        generateSequence(5);

        // Add click listeners to cells
        Array.from(cellElements).forEach((cell, index) => {
            cell.id = `cell-${cells[index]}`;
        });

        handleNextClick(); // Show initial sequence
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This implementation includes:

1. A 3x3 grid of cells that can be clicked by users
2. Computer-generated sequences displayed with color highlights
3. User input validation to check if they match the correct sequence
4. Level progression system:
   - After 3 correct sequences, the level increases in difficulty (sequence length +1)
   - After 3 incorrect attempts at a level, the level decreases in difficulty (sequence length -1)
5. Visual feedback for both correct and incorrect inputs
6. Score tracking
7. Error messages for wrong sequences

To play:
1. The computer will display a sequence of cells with brief color highlights
2. Click on the same sequence of cells in the same order
3. If you match the sequence, click "Next" to proceed to a more difficult sequence
4. If you don't match, try again until you get it right

The game automatically adjusts the difficulty based on your performance:
- Get 3 correct sequences in a row: Next sequence will be longer
- Make 3 mistakes at a given level: Next sequence will be shorter
