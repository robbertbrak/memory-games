                    How to play: you are shown a sequence of letters.
                    The goal is to click the letter that was shown <i>N</i> turns earlier, hence the name "N-Back".
                    For example, suppose you are on level 2 and the initial sequence is D - A - C.
                    The correct answer is then "D".
                    If you give the correct answer, you will get the next letter.
                    Continuing the example, suppose the next letter is B, so the total sequence is D - A - C - B.
                    The correct answer is then "A".
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you give 20 correct answers in a row, you will advance to the next level.
                    If the current level is too easy or too hard, you can always adjust the current level manually.
